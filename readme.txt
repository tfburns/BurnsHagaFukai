This is a code repository for the paper by Burns, Haga, and Fukai titled "Multiscale and extended retrieval of associative memory structures in a cortical model of local-global inhibition balance".

The simulation and main plotting functions can be found in `main.jl`. Some additional plots and anaylsis can be found in `extras.jl`. There are also some helper files, mainly for graph-building but also for some pre-computed results which are computationally-expensive to run.
